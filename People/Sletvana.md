## Working With Them

**Communication Style:**
- Prefers "escalate quick and often" over scheduled daily check-ins
- Responsive via Slack/email for end-of-day questions
- Supportive, collaborative management style
- Tuesday = allocated team day

**What They Care About:**

- Ensuring Calvin isn't overwhelmed by organizational pressure
- PMO team effectiveness and maturity

**What They Need From Me:**
- Early and frequent escalation of blockers
- Transparency about challenges and questions
- End-of-day summaries during Week 1
- Proactive communication on organizational navigation issues

**How to Work Best Together:**

- Use her as organizational "GPS" for navigating matrix structure
- Send brief end-of-day Slack updates during first week
- Be transparent about pressure/expectations and manage them together
- Leverage her organizational influence for blockers
