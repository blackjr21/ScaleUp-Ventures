## Personal Notes
- Only 2 weeks tenure at Claritev - very new like Calvin
- TPM for Christine (AI Scientists team)
- Limited understanding of boundaries currently - opportunity to define together
- Christine's team has multiple dependencies on Nitin's Engineering team
- Shared newness creates opportunity for "fellow travelers" alliance
- Quick win opportunity: Co-create boundary definition within 2-3 weeks
- Present unified TPM approach to Nitin and Christine
- Build joint onboarding support system
- AI Scientists team currently blocked on OCI VM access - Madhu likely feels pressure on this too
