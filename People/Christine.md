- Likely values results and follow-through over process discussion
- High expectations for responsiveness on blockers

**What They Care About:**

**What They Need From Me:**
- Quick resolution of blockers (especially OCI VM access)
- Clear accountability for Engineering deliverables that impact her team
- Reliable partner for cross-team dependency management
