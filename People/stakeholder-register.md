## Notes

### **Missing Information to Gather**
- [ ] Contact info (Slack handles, emails) for all stakeholders
- [ ] Timezone information for Christine, Madhu, John, Abrar, team members
- [ ] Communication preferences for most stakeholders
- [ ] Identify Responsible AI Lead name and contact
- [ ] Identify AI Program Lead name and contact
- [ ] OCI Team contact person and escalation path

### **Relationship Risks to Monitor**
1. **Christine** - Team currently blocked on OCI VMs; "very tough"; needs quick blocker resolution
2. **Madhu** - Both new (2 weeks); unclear boundaries could create confusion/conflict
3. **Multiple new team members** - Limited institutional knowledge across organization

### **Quick Win Opportunities**
1. **Week 1:** Resolve OCI VM blocker → builds credibility with Christine
2. **Week 2:** Launch JIRA board → demonstrates core responsibility delivery
3. **Week 3:** Document TPM boundaries with Madhu → prevents future conflicts
