* **LOW (<$500):** Dec 04, Dec 05, Dec 06, Dec 11

## 5) Suggestions (to avoid any negatives)

* **Option A:** Arrange bridge funding of $992.65 by 2025-12-10. Eliminates all 4 negative balance days and provides $500 buffer. Implementation: Transfer from savings, request advance from employer, or arrange short-term credit line
* **Option B:** Move LoanCare Mortgage from Dec 5 to Dec 12 (after Claritev paycheck). Shifts $3,566.24 expense to align with income, reduces severity of negative periods. Implementation: Contact LoanCare at least 10 days in advance to request payment date change
* **Option C:** Pause NFCU Volvo daily payments during negative periods (3 weekdays). Saves $99.00, improves lowest balance by same amount. Implementation: Contact NFCU to request temporary payment suspension or deferment
