## 4) Alerts

* **NEG (<$0):** Dec 7, Dec 8, Dec 9, Dec 10 (4-day stretch)
* **LOW (<$500):** Dec 4, Dec 5, Dec 6, Dec 11 (4 days total)

## 5) Suggestions (to avoid any negatives)

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** You will go negative Dec 7-10 due to the gap between Claritev deposit (Dec 5) and Acrisure payroll (Dec 12).

* **Option A: Add bridge transfer $800 on Dec 6**
  * Transfer $800 from savings/credit on Friday Dec 6 (after Claritev $3,500 arrives Dec 5)
  * This prevents all 4 negative days
  * Trough improves from -$780.49 to +$19.51
  * Can repay when Acrisure payroll arrives Dec 12 (+$4,487)

* **Option B: Defer Sleep Number payment ($434.58)**
  * Contact Sleep Number to move Dec 7 payment to Dec 13 (after Acrisure payroll)
  * Reduces trough from -$780.49 to -$345.91 (still negative but less severe)
  * Would still need ~$400 bridge to avoid negatives entirely

* **Option C: Request early Acrisure draw**
  * If possible, request $1,000 early distribution from Dec 12 paycheck to arrive Dec 9
  * This would eliminate the worst days (Dec 9-10)
  * Trough improves from -$780.49 to $219.51
  * Dec 12 paycheck would be reduced to $3,487 (still strong)

**RECOMMENDATION:** Option A is cleanest - single $800 bridge transfer on Dec 6, fully repaid Dec 12.
