    "reasoning": "The Hybrid Avalanche with Promotional Defense First strategy is the optimal choice for your situation because it:\n\n1. SAVES IMMEDIATE MONEY: Defending 6 promotional balances saves $1,972.22 in deferred interest - this is guaranteed money saved in the first 6 months.\n\n2. MINIMIZES TOTAL INTEREST: After promotional phase, pure avalanche attack minimizes total interest on unsecured debts ($87,262 vs $106,842 for snowball).\n\n3. PROVIDES QUICK WINS: 11 accounts closed in first year aligns perfectly with your 'quick_wins' motivation style.\n\n4. CLEAR STRUCTURE: Two distinct phases make execution simple: Phase 1 = Defend promos (6 months), Phase 2 = Avalanche attack (84 months).\n\n5. AGGRESSIVE YET SUSTAINABLE: Matches your aggressive risk tolerance while working within $500/month extra payment capacity.\n\n6. MORTGAGE-AWARE: Keeps both mortgages (LoanCare 4.875% and SPS 8.375%) at minimum payments while focusing fire on unsecured debt.\n\n7. FASTEST PATH: Reaches unsecured debt freedom in 90 months (May 2033), freeing up $4,898.57/month to attack mortgages or invest.",
