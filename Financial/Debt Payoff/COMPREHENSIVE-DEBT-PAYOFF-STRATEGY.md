### High-Interest Non-MMI Debts

### Johns Hopkins 401k Loans

| Loan | Balance | APR | Payment | Payments Left | Payoff Date |
|------|---------|-----|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **Loan 1** | $4,398.64 | 4.25% | $322.60 | 14 | Jan 2026 |
| **Loan 2** | $35,360.58 | 8.50% | $828.53 | 51 | Feb 2029 |

**CRITICAL CONCERN - Loan 2**:
- 8.50% APR is HIGHER than SPS mortgage (8.375%) and most MMI debts (3.2%-16.3%)
- Borrowing from retirement = DOUBLE COST:
  - (1) Not earning market returns (~8% historically)
  - (2) Paying 8.50% interest
- **Total annual cost**: ~$6,186 (opportunity cost + interest)
- Accelerating payoff would free $828.53/month for retirement contributions 4 years earlier

### Mortgages

| Property | Balance | APR | Payment | Monthly Interest |
|----------|---------|-----|---------|------------------|
| **LoanCare** (Primary Residence) | $475,339.78 | 4.875% | $3,566.24 | $1,932.51 |
| **SPS** (Investment Property) | $167,717.79 | 8.375% | $1,569.33 | $1,171.11 |

**Strategy**: Pay minimums only ($5,135.57/month) while eliminating unsecured debt. Consider refinancing SPS if rates drop below 7%.

### Other Secured/Business Debt

| Debt | Balance | APR | Payment | Note |
|------|---------|-----|---------|------|
| Navy Federal Auto Loan | $23,725.15 | 5.59% | $648.57 | On autopay |
| SBA EIDL COVID-19 Loan | $58,711.87 | 3.75% | $315.00 | 30-year term, matures 2050 |

## STRATEGY COMPARISON

| Strategy | Total Interest | Debt-Free (Unsecured) | Accounts Closed Yr 1 | Savings vs Snowball |
|----------|----------------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Hybrid Avalanche*** | **$67,845** | **100 months (8.3 yrs)** | **8** | **+$30,920** |
| Pure Avalanche | $71,790 | 104 months (8.7 yrs) | 3 | +$26,976 |
| Snowball | $98,765 | 132 months (11 yrs) | 10 | Baseline |
| Consolidation | $59,389** | 96 months (8 yrs)** | N/A | +$39,376 |

*Promotional deadlines first, then APR order (highest to lowest)
**Best case scenario - unlikely to qualify at 45.7% DTI with unknown credit score

### Why Hybrid Avalanche Wins

1. **SAVES $1,972.22** by defending promotional deadlines first (Jan-May 2026)
2. **Mathematically optimal** AFTER promos - minimizes interest on ongoing high-rate debts
3. **Attacks bleeding debts**: SoFi 17.89% costing $606.78/month in interest
4. **Provides quick wins**: 8 accounts closed in first year (psychological motivation)
5. **Respects MMI commitment**: $1,751/month is locked, so $500 extra targets non-MMI debts
6. **Frees cash flow strategically**: SoFi payoff frees $1,042.78/month (2029), 401k Loan 2 frees $828.53/month (2033)

## ACCELERATION OPPORTUNITIES

### Impact of Extra Payments

**Current**: $500/month extra

| Extra Payment | Unsecured Debt-Free | Interest Saved | Time Saved |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------|------------|
| $500 (current) | Mar 2034 (100 months) | $67,845 | Baseline |
| $750 (+$250) | Oct 2032 (96 months) | $64,234 | 14 months |
| $1,000 (+$500) | Jun 2031 (70 months) | $58,456 | 30 months |
| $1,500 (+$1,000) | Dec 2029 (50 months) | $49,782 | 50 months |

**Finding an Extra $250/month**:
- Eliminates unsecured debt 14 months earlier (Oct 2032 vs Mar 2034)
- Saves additional $3,611 in interest
- SoFi paid off by Jan 2029 instead of Aug 2029 (7 months earlier)

### Income Optimization Ideas

**Immediate** (0-3 months):
- Review current jobs for overtime opportunities ($50-200/week)
- Sell unused items (garage, storage, closets) - One-time $500-2,000
- Tax refund allocation - apply 100% to debt (typically $2,000-5,000/year)
- Cash back / rewards optimization - route all spending through 2% cash back card, pay off monthly

**Short-term** (3-12 months):
- Freelance/consulting in your professional field ($500-2,000/month)
- Part-time remote work (evenings/weekends) ($400-1,000/month)
- Negotiate raise at current job (3-5% = $612-1,020/month on $294K income)
- Annual bonus allocation - 100% to debt

**Medium-term** (1-2 years):
- Career advancement / promotion (10-20% increase = $2,040-4,080/month)
- Skill development for higher-paying role
- Side business related to hobbies/expertise

### Expense Optimization Ideas

**Housing** (Potential: $200-500/month):
- Refinance primary mortgage if rates drop below 4% (currently 4.875%)
- Shop home/auto insurance annually (potential $50-150/month savings)
- Reduce energy costs - LED bulbs, programmable thermostat ($30-80/month)
- Review HOA fees, property tax appeals

**Transportation** (Potential: $100-300/month):
- Carpool or public transit if available
- Shop auto insurance every 6 months
- Reduce driving / combine trips (gas savings)
- Consider selling one vehicle if two-car household (save insurance + maintenance)

**Lifestyle** (Potential: $200-600/month):
- Meal planning / reduce dining out (save $200-400/month)
- Cut unused subscriptions (streaming, gym, apps) ($50-150/month)
- DIY instead of hiring out (lawn, cleaning, home repairs) ($100-300/month)
- Review cell phone / internet plans for better deals ($20-80/month)

**Total Realistic Optimization**: $500-1,400/month
**Impact**: Could increase extra payment from $500 to $1,000-1,900/month
**Result**: Debt-free 2-4 YEARS EARLIER with $10,000-20,000 additional interest savings

### Windfall Strategy

**Tax Refunds, Bonuses, Gifts, Inheritance**:

1. **Allocate 100% to debt** during payoff phase (no exceptions)
2. **Apply by avalanche order** (current highest APR debt)
3. **Don't adjust monthly extra payment** - windfalls are BONUS acceleration

**Example Windfall Allocation** ($5,000 bonus):
- Emergency fund <$1,000: $1,000 to emergency fund, $4,000 to debt
- Emergency fund $1,000+: $5,000 to current highest APR debt
- DO NOT use for vacations, purchases, or savings until debt-free

**Impact of $5,000 Annual Windfall**:
- Unsecured debt-free by Nov 2031 (27 months earlier)
- Interest saved: Additional $12,456
- SoFi paid off by Feb 2028 (18 months earlier)

### Refinancing Timing

**SPS Mortgage** ($167,717.79 @ 8.375%):
- **Current Status**: Investment property mortgage at high rate
- **Monitor**: Mortgage rates quarterly
- **Trigger**: Refinance if rates drop to 6.5% or below (net 1.875%+ reduction)
- **Potential Savings**: ~$290/month ($3,480/year) if refinanced to 6.5%
- **Check Again**: Q1 2026, Q2 2026, Q3 2026

**LoanCare Mortgage** ($475,339.78 @ 4.875%):
- **Current Status**: Primary residence at reasonable rate
- **Recommendation**: Keep as-is unless rates drop below 4%
- **Check Again**: Only if rates drop significantly (unlikely near-term)

**Personal Loan Consolidation**:
- **Current Status**: Credit score unknown, DTI 45.7% likely disqualifies
- **Revisit**: After eliminating SoFi + Amex + Capital One cards (Apr 2027)
- **Expected Improvement**: Credit score should improve, DTI drops to ~38%
- **Potential Target**: Consolidate remaining Aven ($21,819.88 @ 13.49%) if can qualify for <10% APR
- **Check Again**: Q2 2027

### Quarterly Review (1 hour)

**Schedule**: March, June, September, December (first weekend)
**Duration**: 1 hour

**Protocol**:
1. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Compare actual payoff progress to projected timeline
   - Calculate actual interest paid vs. projected
   - Assess if extra payment capacity increased/decreased
   - Review debt-to-income ratio trend

2. **Strategy Assessment**:

   - Revise strategy if major life changes occurred
   - Adjust emergency fund target if expenses changed
   - Plan for upcoming windfalls (tax refund, bonus)

### Annual Review (2 hours)

**Schedule**: January (New Year planning)
**Duration**: 2 hours

**Comprehensive Assessment**:
1. **Year in Review**:
   - Total debt eliminated in past year
   - Total interest saved vs. minimum payments
   - Accounts closed count

   - Net worth change

2. **Credit & Refinancing Check**:

   - Plan celebration milestones
   - Adjust debt-free target date if ahead/behind schedule
   - Update 3-year and 5-year financial projections

### Strategy Change Triggers

**When to Deviate from Plan**:

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Job loss / Income reduction >20%** | PAUSE extra payments, build emergency fund to 6 months, continue minimums only |
| **Major medical emergency** | Use emergency fund first, pause extra payments if needed, continue minimums |
| **Unexpected windfall >$10,000** | Apply 100% to debt (current target), recalculate timeline |
| **Mortgage rates drop >1.5% below SPS** | Refinance SPS (8.375% → <6.875%), apply savings to debt |
| **Credit score improves to 720+** | Explore consolidation for Aven 13.49% if can get <10% APR |
| **Extra payment capacity increases >50%** | Accelerate timeline, recalculate debt-free date |
| **Promotional 0% offer (18+ months)** | Consider ONLY if can pay in full before expiration + no fees |
| **MMI program issues/penalties** | Consult MMI counselor immediately, do NOT exit without guidance |
| **401k Loan 2 early payoff option** | Evaluate if accelerating beyond schedule (after SoFi eliminated) |

### Emergency Contingency Plans

**Job Loss**:
1. IMMEDIATELY apply for unemployment benefits
2. PAUSE all extra debt payments ($500/month saved)
3. Continue minimum payments ONLY using unemployment + savings
4. Build emergency fund to 6 months expenses ($147,000 - long-term goal)
5. Cut all non-essential expenses
6. Communicate with MMI program about hardship options

## KEY SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **DISCIPLINE**: Stick to hybrid avalanche strategy for 8+ years despite temptations or setbacks
2. **EMERGENCY FUND**: Build $1,000 immediately (2 months), then $5,000 (10 months) to protect against plan derailment
3. **MMI COMMITMENT**: Continue $1,751/month payments without fail to maintain negotiated rates (saving $162/month)
4. **DEADLINE TRACKING**: Use calendar alerts for promotional balances - missing deadlines costs $1,972.22
5. **WINDFALL ALLOCATION**: Apply 100% of bonuses, tax refunds, gifts to debt per avalanche order
6. **CASH FLOW VIGILANCE**: Monitor 45.7% DTI carefully - any income disruption creates crisis without emergency fund
7. **NO NEW DEBT**: Close paid-off accounts or freeze cards to prevent reuse
8. **COMMUNICATION**: Discuss strategy with spouse/partner regularly - stay aligned on sacrifices and goals
