## RISK FACTORS & MITIGATION

### Current Risks:

1. **Emergency Fund Critically Low** ($300)
   - Risk: Any unexpected expense could derail plan
   - Mitigation: Build to $1,000 immediately, then $24,500 (1-month expenses)

2. **High DTI** (41% of income)
   - Risk: Little margin for income disruption
   - Mitigation: Maintain emergency fund, continue income diversification

3. **Promotional Deadlines** ($1,972 at risk)
   - Risk: Missing deadlines triggers deferred interest
   - Mitigation: Calendar alerts, dedicated tracking, Phase 1 focus

4. **Ashley PayPal Past Due** ($41)
   - Risk: Penalty APR, additional fees
   - Mitigation: Pay minimum $92 immediately

5. **SoFi High Interest** ($607/month)
   - Risk: Largest monthly interest cost
   - Mitigation: Target for elimination after promotional phase (Month 49)

### Contingency Plans:

**Job Loss**:
- Switch to minimums-only mode immediately
- Use emergency fund for essential expenses only
- Continue MMI program if possible
- Pause extra payments until re-employed

**Medical Emergency**:
- Use emergency fund first
- Medical debt goes to bottom of priority (0% interest, negotiate)
- Maintain all minimum payments if possible
- Contact MMI for guidance

**Unexpected Major Expense** (>$1,000):
- Use emergency fund
- Temporarily reduce extra payments if needed
- Resume strategy after emergency resolved
