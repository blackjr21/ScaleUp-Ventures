## STRATEGY COMPARISON (UPDATED)

### Strategy 1: Pure Avalanche (Highest APR First)

- **Debt-Free Date**: April 2033 (88 months) - 3 months faster than before
- **Pros**: Minimizes total interest mathematically

### Strategy 2: Pure Snowball (Smallest Balance First)
- **Total Unsecured Interest Paid**: $97,118 (down from $106,842 with old rates)
- **Debt-Free Date**: December 2033 (96 months)
- **Pros**: 8 accounts closed in first year, strong psychological momentum

### Strategy 3: Hybrid Avalanche with Promotional Defense (RECOMMENDED)
- **Total Unsecured Interest Paid**: $77,538 (down from $87,262 with old rates)
- **Debt-Free Date**: April 2033 (88 months) - 3 months faster than before

## ACCELERATION OPPORTUNITIES

### Impact of Extra Payments

Current extra payment: $500/month + $162/month rate reduction savings = $662/month effective

**What if you could pay more?**

| Extra Payment | Debt-Free Date | Months Saved | Interest Saved |
|---------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Current ($500) | April 2033 | Baseline | Baseline |
| $750/month | October 2032 | 6 months | $8,500 |
| $1,000/month | May 2032 | 11 months | $15,200 |
| $1,500/month | October 2031 | 18 months | $24,800 |

**Finding Extra Money**:

**Income Optimization**:
- Side hustle ($500-2,000/month potential)
- Sell unused items ($1,000-5,000 one-time)
- Negotiate raise/promotion (5-10% = $1,225-2,450/month)
- Tax refund (redirect to debt)
- Work bonuses (apply 100% to debt)

**Expense Optimization**:
- Review subscriptions (target: $100-300/month savings)
- Reduce dining out (target: $200-400/month savings)
- Shop sales/use coupons (target: $100-200/month savings)
- Refinance SPS mortgage if rates drop (potential: $260/month savings)

**Windfall Strategy**:
- Tax refunds → Promotional debts first, then SoFi
- Work bonuses → SoFi loan principal
- Inheritance/gifts → SoFi or highest APR debt
- Side hustle income → Extra payments in avalanche order

   - Pause extra payments until stabilized

3. **Large Windfall Received** (>$10,000)
   - Action: Allocate to SoFi loan or highest APR debt

   - Apply $260/month savings to debt payoff

5. **New 0% Balance Transfer Offer Available**

   - Even 3-5% fee worth it to eliminate 17.89% interest

6. **Promotional Deadline at Risk**

### Emergency Contingency Plans

**Job Loss**:
