    "notes": "MANAGEABLE BUT HIGH DEBT LOAD: $241,413.98 unsecured debt + $643,057.57 mortgages = $884,471.55 total household debt. Monthly debt service: $10,034.14 on $24,500 household income = 41.0% DTI. This is HIGH but SUSTAINABLE - typical mortgage-only DTI is 28-36%, but with $294K annual income, household can absorb this level. User has $500 extra payment capacity. ✅ PHASE 1 100% COMPLETE (11/21/25): Paid $1,763.57 total - resolved Marriott Amex overlimit crisis + defended CareCredit promo deadline (saved $49.94) + cleared Navy Federal auto past due. NEW: Added Ashley PayPal Credit $830.22 (account ending 7934) - separate from Calvin's PayPal Credit. Account is $41 past due. MORTGAGES ADDED: LoanCare primary residence $475,339.78 @ 4.875% ($3,566.24/month) + SPS investment property $167,717.79 @ 8.375% ($1,569.33/month) = $643,057.57 total mortgages. STRATEGY: 1) URGENT: Pay Ashley PayPal $92 minimum ASAP to avoid additional late fees and penalty APR, 2) URGENT: Pay remaining promotional balances by deadlines to save $1,971.44 in deferred interest (includes Ashley's $751.62 promo expiring 05/05/26), 3) AVALANCHE ATTACK: Focus $500/month extra on highest unsecured rates: SoFi 17.89% ($606/month interest - priority #1), Navy Federal CCs 16.7%-14.1% (next priorities), Aven 13.49%, then down the list. SBA EIDL at 3.75% with 30-year term should be LAST unsecured priority - only pay minimums. Mortgages: Pay minimums on both. SPS at 8.375% is higher than LoanCare but still lower than most unsecured debts - keep minimum payments only. Consider refinancing SPS if rates drop. With disciplined extra payments, unsecured debt is eliminable in 5-7 years. Mortgages are long-term (investment property could be sold to accelerate if desired). Current situation is sustainable - NOT a crisis."
