---

## Overview

This document explains the methodology used to evaluate and rank 12 UTMA/UGMA custodial account providers for a beginning investor starting with $50.

---

## Evaluation Criteria & Weighting

### 1. Cost Structure (25% of total score)

**Why it matters most:**
For small accounts ($50 starting balance), fees have an outsized impact on returns. A $5/month fee represents 120% annual cost on a $50 balance, making it the most critical factor.

**Scoring factors:**
- Account minimum requirement (0-5 points)
- Monthly/annual maintenance fees (0-10 points)
- Stock/ETF trading commissions (0-5 points)
- Options contract fees (0-3 points)
- Other fees: transfer, inactivity, closure (0-2 points)

**Perfect score example:** $0 minimum, $0 monthly fee, $0 stock trades, $0.50-0.65 options = 25/25

**Scoring deductions:**
- Monthly fee: -10 points per $1/month
- Account minimum: -1 point per $100 required
- Trading commission: -5 points if any commission
- High options fee (>$1): -2 points

---

### 2. Investment Flexibility (20% of total score)

**Why it's critical:**
A $50 starting investment requires fractional shares to build a diversified portfolio. Without fractional shares, one share of many quality stocks exceeds the entire account balance.

**Scoring factors:**
- Fractional share availability (0-8 points)
  - All stocks/ETFs: 8 points
  - S&P 500 only: 6 points
  - Limited selection: 4 points
  - None: 0 points
- Investment variety (0-6 points)
  - Stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, bonds, options: 6 points
  - Stocks and ETFs only: 4 points
  - Very limited: 2 points
- Minimum investment per trade (0-4 points)
  - $1 minimum: 4 points
  - $5-10 minimum: 3 points
  - $25-50 minimum: 2 points
  - Full share price: 0-1 points
- Access to low-cost index funds (0-2 points)

**Perfect score example:** All stocks fractional, full investment variety, $1 minimum, zero-fee index funds = 20/20

---

### 3. Educational Value (20% of total score)

**Why it's important:**
For a 10-year-old beginning investor, learning about money and investing is as valuable as returns. The account should be a teaching tool, not just a savings vehicle.

**Scoring factors:**
- Youth-specific learning resources (0-6 points)
  - Dedicated youth app/interface: 6 points
  - Age-appropriate content: 4 points
  - Generic educational content: 2 points
  - None: 0 points
- Research and analysis tools (0-6 points)
  - Professional-grade tools simplified for learners: 6 points
  - Good research tools: 4 points
  - Basic tools: 2 points
  - Minimal: 0 points
- Parental oversight features (0-4 points)
  - Real-time monitoring and controls: 4 points
  - Basic oversight: 2 points
  - None: 0 points
- Interactive learning features (0-4 points)
  - Portfolio simulations, lessons, games: 4 points
  - Static content only: 1 point

**Perfect score example:** Youth app with lessons, strong research tools, parental controls, interactive features = 20/20

---

### 4. Ease of Use (15% of total score)

**Why it matters:**
A 10-year-old and parent need an intuitive platform that doesn't create frustration. Complex interfaces discourage engagement and learning.

**Scoring factors:**
- Account opening process (0-4 points)
  - Fully online, <20 minutes: 4 points
  - Online but complex: 2 points
  - Requires paper/phone: 0 points
- Mobile app quality (0-5 points)
  - Excellent, intuitive, youth-friendly: 5 points
  - Good, functional: 3 points
  - Poor or none: 0-1 points
- Platform intuitiveness (0-4 points)
  - Simple, clear navigation: 4 points
  - Moderate complexity: 2 points
  - Confusing: 0 points
- Customer service (0-2 points)
  - 24/7 phone + chat: 2 points
  - Limited hours: 1 point
  - Email only: 0 points

**Perfect score example:** Fast online opening, excellent app, intuitive platform, 24/7 support = 15/15

### 5. Features for Small Investors (10% of total score)

**Why it's relevant:**
Starting with $50 requires specific features that larger investors take for granted. Traditional minimums and requirements can be dealbreakers.

**Scoring factors:**
- Practical minimum trade size (0-4 points)
  - $1-5: 4 points
  - $10-25: 2 points
  - $50+: 0 points
- Automatic investment options (0-3 points)
  - Flexible auto-invest with low minimums: 3 points
  - Auto-invest with restrictions: 2 points
  - None: 0 points
- Dividend reinvestment (0-2 points)
  - Automatic DRIP available: 2 points
  - None: 0 points
- Portfolio building tools (0-1 point)
  - Model portfolios or guidance: 1 point

**Perfect score example:** $1 trades, flexible auto-invest, DRIP, model portfolios = 10/10

### 6. Platform Quality (10% of total score)

**Why it matters:**
Reliability, tools, and features affect the long-term experience. However, for a beginning investor, this is less critical than costs and educational value.

**Scoring factors:**
- Platform reliability and uptime (0-3 points)
  - Industry-leading: 3 points
  - Good track record: 2 points
  - Frequent issues: 0 points
- Research tools quality (0-3 points)
  - Professional-grade: 3 points
  - Good tools: 2 points
  - Basic: 1 point

**Perfect score example:** Rock-solid platform, professional tools, great tracking, advanced features = 10/10

## Scoring Methodology

### Total Score Calculation:
- Maximum possible score: 100 points
- Scores are calculated by summing weighted category scores
- Final scores are normalized to 100-point scale

### Rating Categories:
- **90-100:** Excellent - Top tier recommendation
- **80-89:** Very Good - Strong choice with minor limitations
- **70-79:** Good - Viable option with some tradeoffs
- **60-69:** Fair - Acceptable but with significant limitations
- **Below 60:** Poor - Not recommended

## Special Considerations for $50 Starting Investment

### Critical Factors:
1. **No monthly fees** - Absolutely essential (eliminates Acorns for most situations)
2. **Fractional shares** - Required for diversification
3. **$0 minimum** - Required to open with $50
4. **$1-5 trade minimums** - Enables multiple positions

### Automatic Disqualifiers:
- Monthly fees (unless account value will be >$5,000 within 6 months)
- Account minimums >$0
- High trading commissions (>$1 per trade)
- No fractional shares AND high stock prices
- Poor educational resources (defeats learning purpose)
