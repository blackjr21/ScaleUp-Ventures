| Casts | None seen | None seen /lpf | Normal |
| Bacteria | None seen | None seen/Few | Normal |

## Abnormal Results
- **Blood: 3+** - Indicates presence of blood/hemoglobin in urine
- **WBC Esterase: Trace** - Suggests possible white blood cells

## Clinical Notes
**Important Finding:** Blood detected on dipstick (3+) but no RBCs seen on microscopic examination. This discrepancy suggests possible:
- Hemoglobinuria (free hemoglobin in urine from red blood cell breakdown)
- Myoglobinuria (myoglobin from muscle breakdown)
- Dilute urine causing RBC lysis

WBC Esterase trace but no WBCs seen on microscopy - likely clinically insignificant.
